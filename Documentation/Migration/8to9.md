# Migration

These adjustments are only required if one of the following template files has been overwritten:

* Resources/Private/Templates/StudyCourse/FastSearch.html
* Resources/Private/Partials/Pagination.html
* Resources/Private/Partials/StudyCourse/List/Filter.html
* Resources/Private/Partials/StudyCourse/List/Filter/CheckboxAll.html
* Resources/Private/Partials/StudyCourse/List/Filter/TypeBoolean.html
* Resources/Private/Partials/StudyCourse/List/Filter/TypeObject.html
* Resources/Private/Partials/StudyCourse/List/QuickSearch.html
* Resources/Private/Partials/StudyCourse/Detail/contentElements.html

In version 9 the complete JavaScript of the frontend was reworked.
The [select2](https://select2.org/) lib was replaced with [tom-select](https://tom-select.js.org/).
This means that jQuery is no longer required.

## from Select2 to tom-select

The change from select2 to tom-select has the consequence that the appearance of the select changes. This must be taken into account when updating to version 9.

## Content element rendering

the content element is now rendered via f:cObject instead of an individual ViewHelper. Update your contentElements.html

New contentElements.html:
```html
<f:if condition="{studyCourse.contentElements}">
	<f:cObject typoscriptObjectPath="lib.tx_in2studyfinder.contentElementRendering">{studyCourse.contentElementIdList}</f:cObject>
</f:if>
```

## Removed functionality

the data-disable-filter-toggle attribute on the filter form for disabling the automatic filter toggle was removed.
You can now use the `window.in2studyfinder` object to disable the automatic opening after filtering.

```js

if (window.in2studyfinder !== null) {
	let in2studyfinder = window.in2studyfinder;
	let instance = in2studyfinder.getInstance(1);

	if (instance.hasFilter) {
		instance.filter.openFilterOnLoad = false;
	}
}
```

## New classes

There are a bunch of new classes which are required

| new class name                             | template                                                 | line |

| js-in2studyfinder-quick-search             | Resources/Private/Templates/StudyCourse/FastSearch.html  |  17  |

## Changed classes

The following class names have been changed and therefore need to be adjusted

| from                           | to                                 |

| js-in2studyfinder-select2      |  js-in2studyfinder-select          |

## Removed classes

This part is optional but the following classes are not required anymore and can therefore be removed

| class                   |
|-------------------------|
| f3-widget-paginator     |
| pagination              |

| page-item               |
| in2studyfinder-js-radio |
| active                  |
